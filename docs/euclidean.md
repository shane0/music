- this is one of the generative music algirms I use frequently
- euclidean patterns sound good to the ear and can add simplicity or complexity
- some combinations greatly extend the duration of a rhythm
- you can use euclidean rhythms to make music sound less repetitive
- they spread a given number of notes accross a set period of time
- 4/4 is what people are familiar with like a kick drum on 1,2,3,4
- a common beat is kick, snare, kick, snare
- techno is boots & pants & boots & pants
- historically people have written using euclidean rhythms before there was a name for it
- typically they use even and odd combinations
- music hardware and software can quickly generate euclidean music this is why I am a big fan
