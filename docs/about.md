# about

- I am setting this up on 2024-01-06
- previously this was just a page on shanenull.com
- I want a site just for music so I can keep better notes & leave comments
- sometimes I use a lot of different hardware and software
- when the interfaces are not designed well you have to dig around to use features
- deployed using this [workflow template](https://github.com/shane0/workflow)
