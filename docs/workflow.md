# workflow

## update this site

- this is a pretty simple mkdocs material site on github pages
- I use this script to update the site

```sh
./push.sh
```

## general composition

!!! example "a simple workflow for composing music"

    - every step is optional 
    - there are no rules in music
    - start with a song template
    - choose a scale on a master transpose track
    - choose instruments
    - create a periodic linear track
    - layer non linear tracks
    - duplicate and modify tracks to harmonize & counter rhythms or melodies
    - modify the tempo
    - modify all of the above

## DAWLESS music

- DAWLESS means you are using dedicated music hardware to make music as opposed to software (see DAW)
- as of 2024 I typically use my hardware setup (DAWLESS)
- squarp hapax sequences the music
- I have a song template so when I launch a project a bunch of things are done automatically
- a master transpose track is on midi channel 16 and it randomizes the root note every x bars
- sometimes after I finish a song I experiment with different scales and pick my favorite
- the song template assigns midi information for 6 my instruments: 3 plonks & blackbox (2 instruments, drums, keys) & a hydrasynth
- sometimes I send midi program changes to the hydrasynth to change voices on different patterns
- mixing is done with the bluebox
- fx go to a hologram chroma console
- that goes to an ua apollo that has some studio plugins
- the output of the apollo goes to a rode micro into the iphone
- the iphone is on a tripod
- sometimes if I have time I'll use klevgrand grand finale 2 to master the audio
- then mix the mastered audio into the video using imovie

## DAW music

- DAW stands for digital audio workstation
- imo acronyms seriously suck ( see ASS )  
- DAW in english means using software on a laptop to make music
